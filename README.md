# Adaptive Neuro-Attentional Architectures for Early Alzheimer's Disease Classification: A Reinforcement Learning-Based MRI Approach
This work is part of article, what I just apply to **Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence**. I will keep you posted as the review proceeds.

## Introduction 
This approach is ehanced verion of these articles:
1. Podolszańska, J. (2024). Development and Optimization of Deep Learning Systems for MRI Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease Monitoring. Journal of Telecommunications and Information Technology, 56-61.
2. Podolszanska, J. (2025). Leveraging Deep Q-Network Agents with Dynamic Routing Mechanisms in Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced and Reliable Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease from MRI Scans,  Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence.

## About this enhanced version 
This version improves the previous work by enhancing the neural network structure, using ResNet50 instead of the classic ResNet34 architecture. An improvement in the confusion matrix of correctly classified cases is also apparent. Classification performance now oscillates at 98.75%, where originally this performance was 60.86%
